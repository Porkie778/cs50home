                            It's great to meet you! I'm Ben Bruce, and I'm excited to share a bit about my background with you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was born in the northeast of England back in 2000, but when I was just around 2 years old, my parents made the decision to move our family to Ireland. Although I don't have too many direct memories from my early days in England, I've always maintained a close connection to my dad's side of the family who still live there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You see, my dad is English, while my mom is Irish, so I've been fortunate to have this rich, multicultural upbringing. Growing up with that diverse heritage has definitely shaped my perspectives in fascinating ways, even if the initial move to Ireland as a young child was a big adjustment at the time.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, I've stayed in close contact with my dad's family back in England through letters, phone calls, and occasional video chats. That's been so valuable in helping me feel grounded in my roots, while also learning about the unique traditions and viewpoints from both sides of my family. I'm really grateful for that cross-cultural influence and the way it's impacted my interests and outlook on life.

                      <p>Here are more details about my hobbies outside of computing:</p>

                      <p>
                        Since I was 8 years old in 2008, I've been a devoted fan of Formula 1 racing. Watching the high-speed action and technological innovations of the sport has been a lifelong passion of mine. Over the years, I've developed an extensive knowledge of the drivers, teams, and history of Formula 1. I eagerly follow each season, analyzing the performances of my favorite drivers and teams. The thrill of witnessing nail-biting finishes and unexpected race outcomes is something I deeply enjoy. Formula 1 provides an exhilarating escape from the day-to-day, allowing me to immerse myself in the competition and intricacies of this premier motorsport.</p>
                      <p>
                        In addition to my love of motorsports, I've also cultivated a keen interest in photography and photo editing since 2016. I enjoy capturing beautiful or interesting scenes through the lens and then using photo editing software to enhance and refine my images. This creative outlet allows me to express my artistic sensibilities. I take pride in my ability to frame compelling shots and bring out the best in my photographs through careful post-processing. Whether it's landscapes, portraits, or abstract compositions, the act of crafting visually striking images is deeply rewarding for me.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I've also developed a fondness for consuming manhwa, manga, and anime since 2014. These Japanese and Korean art forms have captivated me with their captivating narratives, dynamic visuals, and diverse genres. From epic fantasy sagas to slice-of-life dramas, I've become well-versed in navigating the rich tapestry of storytelling that these mediums offer. The intricate character developments, imaginative worldbuilding, and thought-provoking themes found in manhwa, manga, and anime have expanded my perspectives and broadened my appreciation for creative expression beyond the Western canon.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        These hobbies outside of computing have provided me with a well-rounded set of interests and outlets for my curiosity and creativity. The thrill of Formula 1, the artistic fulfillment of photography, and the immersive experiences of manhwa, manga, and anime all contribute to a diverse and enriching lifestyle beyond the realm of technology and computing. These passions allow me to explore different modes of expression, indulge my senses, and find balance in my life.

                            I was 12 years old when I figured out that I wanted to go into computing. I remember begging my Mom to buy Minecraft for me when I was twelve. Although the game was only $20 at the time, it was still the most amount of money I'd ever asked from my parents until that point. After a week of pleading and listing all of the benefits of this educational(a bit of a stretch, but I was desperate) video game.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the time, I was watching an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtMim1O_2SQ&list=PL310728C6AAFF44B1&index=1">online series</a> on youtube where the people playing Minecraft were modifying the game to create their own storyline. I was fascinated by this, so when I finally got the game, I was ecstatic and immediately tried to modify the game to match what I'd seen in that series.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then promptly broke the game by modding it. I remember the pit in my stomach deepening as the guilt settled in. I had asked my Mom for a lot of money and had immediately broken the game. This was my first game that wasn't something like Club Penguin, so I didn't even think of the possibility of reinstalling the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Driven by the want to not be in trouble, I didn't tell my parents about this and went about trying to fix this by myself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And when I did fix the game by myself, the sense of accomplistment I gained was amazing. From then on, I learned little bits of coding and IT here and there until I registered for a year long PLC(Irish equivalent to Post High School education, but not quite University) in Computer Science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This journey has led me to signing up for the CS50 course this year.
